this is just a loose list i'm keeping. eventually i'll make a beautiful linkedin post about this

-   don't worry too much about planning at first, dive in and figure the big things out as you go. While working on those things, take notes of minor features/bugs you'd like to address THEN come up with your 5-star planning system

-   tasks are always most intimidating before you start them

-   supabase rocks

-   whoever invented css modules deserves every pleasure this world has to offer

-   write spaghetti while you're in that flow state, then refine later once you're having a hard time focusing

-   in web development, not everything you do is gonna feel like the "right way" to do it. Just make it work, then break it, then fix it, then break it, then fix it, on and on until you have a (mostly) unbreakable system. then clean up your code so it doesn't look like a nightmare.

-   use JSDocs for most of your documentation. ESPECIALLY on any reusable functions or components.

-   did i mention css modules are amazing

-   for gods sake use Prettier and ESLint

-   React DevTools are worth learning (helped me figure out why a hugely complex component was re-rendering twice)

-   story
    I was trying to figure out how to allow overflow-x while hiding overflow-y on the fold toggle component. Took an hour, but i figured out that overflow-clip works as i'd expect.
    I figured this out by slowing down the animation a ton and using devtools to try a bunch of different overflow-y values until i got there. big brain moment.
